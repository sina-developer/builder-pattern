# Builder Pattern
Builder Design Pattern

This design pattern can be used to generate complex objects by simple classes 

you can build new complex object without loosing control of base class

you can add new fanctionalities to base class after building complex objects from that

in this example I simulated a Car Factory

and its easy to add new cars with new properities
